While we \\nshall deal with the facts of the present case in \\ndetail later, it is a classic example of continued Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 2 of 56 \\n suffering faced by the common man owing to \\nmala  fide intentions of the vendors who try to \\ngain double -benefits, either by arm -twisting or \\nthrough manipulation of the legal processes. \\nSometimes, the misery of the litigant is deepened \\nwhen such travesty of justice is prolonged for \\ndecades. It is in cases like  these, the law comes \\nto the aid of the weak. While adjudicating such \\ncases, it is not just the lives and the properties of \\nthe people that we are dealing with, but also their \\ntrust in the legal system. I n cases like the one \\nbefore us, it is not for us to just mechanically \\nanalyse the contentious transactions but to also \\nensure that injustice is remedied and nobody is \\nbenefitted by their own wrongs. Justice knows no \\nbias and thus, through its aid, even the  weak \\nmay prevail over the strong.   \\n2. This appeal by the plaintiff assails the \\ncorrectness  of the judgment and order dated 9th \\nJune, 2022 passed by the High Court of \\nJudicature at Bombay , whereby the Second \\nAppeal filed by the defendant no.2 (respondent \\nno.1 herein) was allowed the judgment of the first \\nAppellate  Court was set aside and that of the Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 3 of 56 \\n Trial Court dismissing the suit of the appellant \\nwas maintained.  \\n3. Respondent no.2 was the owner of Survey No.13 \\nHissa No.1 measuring 3.40 Hectares situate in \\nvillage Shel wali, Tehsil Palghar, District Thane, \\nMaharashtra. Half of the total area which would \\ncome to  1.70 Hectares on the western side is the \\nsuit land purchased by the appellants. \\nRemaining half was purchased by collaterals of \\nthe appellants.  \\n4. Relevant facts for appropriate adjudication of this \\nappeal are as follows:  \\n(a) Respondent no.2 herein executed a Sale Deed in \\nfavour of appellant no.1 and his minor brother \\nAmbrish Mishra (since deceased) on 02.12.1985 \\nwith respect to suit land and the appellant  no.1, \\nalong with his brother, was put into possession \\nof the same.  \\n(b) On the same date another Sale Deed was \\nexecuted by the respondent no.2 in favour of \\none Param Umakant Mishra and Sohardha \\nJagdish Mishra (collaterals of the appellant s) for \\nthe remaining half portion.  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 4 of 56 \\n (c) On 05.12.1985 both the aforementioned Sale \\nDeeds were presented for registration before the \\nSub-Registrar , Palghar.  \\n(d) The Sale Deed in favour of Param Mishra and \\nSohardha Mishra was registered  and later  on \\ntheir names were mutated in the revenue \\nrecords. However, on account of deficiency in \\nstamp duty,  the Sale Deed in favour of the \\nappellant no.1 and his minor brother could not \\nbe registered and remain ed pending for \\nregistration before the Sub -Registrar.  As such \\ntheir names could not be incorporated in the \\nrevenue records and the name of the respondent \\nno.2 continued to be recorded.  \\n(e) It would be relevant to mention that in the Sale \\nDeed it was mentioned that the appellant no.1 \\nis aged 18 years whereas his brother Ambrish, \\nwas a minor and was represented through his \\nnatural guardian -mother  (Smt. Malti).  \\n(f) On 8th October, 1999, brother of the appellant \\nAmbrish passed away issueless and later on his \\nwidow re -married , as such,  his parents became \\nthe successors  and legal heirs of the estate of \\nAmbrish . Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 5 of 56 \\n (g) On 3rd December, 2010 respondent no.2 \\nexecuted a Conveyance Deed with respect to the \\nsuit land in favour of respondent no.1. It is the \\nsame land which was transferred in favour of \\nthe appellant no.1 and his brother in December, \\n1985 . \\n(h) On 8th June, 2011 the appellant s came to know \\nabout inspection of the suit land by some \\nstrangers , so they went to the spot. They found \\nthat respondent no.1, along with some \\nmusclemen , was trying to take possession of the \\nsuit land but on account of suit land being \\nprotected by fencing, they could not enter.  It \\nwas at that time the appellant  no.1 came to \\nknow about a conveyance deed  in favour of  \\nrespondent no.1 on the basis of which he was \\ntrying to take possession . \\n(i) The appellant s thereafter made inquiries in the \\noffice of the Sub -Registrar and came to know \\nthat there was a sale deed dated 3rd December, \\n2010  in favour of respondent no.1   \\n(j) After obtain ing a certified copy of the said Deed , \\nwhich was received on 14th June 2011 , the \\npicture bec ame clear  to the appellant . The fraud Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 6 of 56 \\n played on them by respondent no.2 of \\ntransfer ring the same property (suit land) in \\nfavour of respondent no.1 , which had been \\nearlier transferred in their favour , became \\napparent.  \\n(k)  The appellants then followed up registration of \\ntheir sale deed. After removing the deficiency  in \\nstamp duty , the sale deed executed  on \\n02.12.1985  and presented for registration on \\n05.12.1985 before the Sub -Registrar came to be \\nregistered on 14th June, 2011.  The above \\nincident of interference in possession by the \\nrespondent no.1 gave rise to filing of the suit.  \\n5. The appellant s along with Premkumar , father of \\nappellant no.1 , instituted a suit for cancellation \\nof sale deed dated 03.12.2010 and for perpetual \\ninjunction on 27th June, 2011 which was \\nregistered as Special Civil Suit No.46  of 2011.  \\nThe vendor was impleaded as defendant No.1 \\n(respondent no.2  herein ) and the subsequent \\npurchaser as defendant No.2  (respondent no.1  \\nherein ). The facts as stated in paragraph 4 above \\nare pleaded in the plaint as such are not being \\nrepeated.  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 7 of 56 \\n 6. Both the defendants filed separate written \\nstatement s. The written statement filed by the \\ndefendant no.1 averred that the plaintiff was not \\nentitled to any of the relief s; the suit was barred \\nby limitation ; the land in suit was owned by him ; \\nthat he did not recollect having executed any \\nsuch sale deed in favour of the appellant no.1 \\nand his brother ; that the plaintiff purchasers \\nwere minors , as such , the sale deed in their \\nfavour was void ; it was also denied that \\ndefendant no.2 had tried to trespass the pro perty \\nand take forcible possession with the help of \\nmusclemen.  \\n7. Defendant no.2 in his written statement averred \\nthat the valuation of the suit was not proper ; that \\nno cause of action arose to file the suit ; that the \\nplaintiffs had supressed  material facts and \\ndocuments and , as such , the suit was liable to be \\ndismissed ; that the plaintiff no.1 and his brother \\nAmbrish were minors and , as such incompetent \\nto contract ; that as per section 11 of the Indian \\nContract Act, 18721 the transaction with minor \\n \\n1 The Act, 1872  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 8 of 56 \\n was void and as such unenforceable in law ; that \\nguardian of minor Ambrish was shown as his \\nmother whereas actually it should have been his \\nfather and therefore also the sale deed was bad; \\nthat there was no signature of plaintiff no.2 in the \\nsale deed; that the widow of brother Ambrish was \\nnot made a party , as such , the suit was bad for \\nnon-joinder of the  necessary party ; that the sale \\ndeed was not duly registered as per provisions of \\nlaw; that before registration no notice was issued \\nto the vendor i.e. defendant no.1 ; no explanation \\nor details were  given with regard to the delay of \\n26 years in  getting the registration; that under \\nsection 85 of the Registration Act, 19082, the \\ndocuments pending for two years were liable to \\nbe destroyed , as such , the sale deed was not legal \\nand proper; that there was inter polation in the \\ndocuments of sale; that he was bona fide  \\npurchaser for value and had done so after \\nverification of the title from the revenue records  \\nas also having search ed the records of the Sub -\\n \\n2 The Act, 1908  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 9 of 56 \\n Registrar; lastly, it was prayed that the suit be \\ndismissed.  \\n8. In the written statement of the respondent no.2 \\n(defendant no.1) there was no specific denial of \\nthe execution of the Sale Deed on 02.12.1985 in \\nfavour of the appellant no.1 and his brother.  \\nThere was also no specific or even general denial \\nof not receiving the sale consideration.  No suit for \\ncancellation of the said Sale Deed has ever been \\nfiled nor any counter claim was filed by the \\ndefendants to the suit filed by the  appellants  \\nassailing the sale deed dated 02.12.1985.  \\n9. On the basis of the pleadings , the Trial Court \\nframed the following issues:   \\n“(i) Do plaintiffs prove that they are in possession and \\noccupation of the suit land?  \\n(ii) Do plaintiffs prove that they are owners of the \\nsuit land by virtue of registered Sale Deed dated \\n02/12/1985?  \\n(iii)Do plaintiffs prove that the defendants were \\ntrying to take possession of the suit land forcibly \\nand unauthorizedly?  \\n(iv)Do plaintiffs prove that the Deed of Conveyance \\ndated 03/12/2010 registered at serial No.9176 is \\nvoid-ab-initio?  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 10 of 56 \\n (v)Do plaintiffs prove that they are entitle for relief \\nof permanent injunction against the defendants as \\nprayed in the suit?  \\n(vi)Do plaintiffs prove that they are entitled for any \\nother relief?  \\n(vii)Does defendant No.1 prove that the alleged \\nAgreement to Sale d ated 02/12/1985 is void -ab-\\ninitio?  \\n(viii)Does defendant No.1 prove that the plaintiffs’  \\nsuit is barred by limitation?  \\n(ix)Does defendant No.2 prove that the Sale Deed \\ndated 02/12/1985 was not enforceable by law?  \\n(x)Does defendant No.2 prove that he is bona  fide \\npurchaser and the possessor of suit land?  \\n(xi)What order and decree? ”  \\n10. The parties to the suit led evidence , both oral and \\ndocumentary. On behalf of the plaintiffs Kaushik \\nPremkumar Mishra examined himself as PW -1 \\nand further examine d Shri Mohan Joshi , \\nAdvocate  as PW -2 and Prashant Mishra as PW -3. \\nThey also filed documentary evidence which \\nincluded amongst others (i) sale deed dated \\n02.12.1985, (ii)  certified copy of 7/12  extract of \\nsuit property, (iii) mutation entry no.668, (iv) Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 11 of 56 \\n Form No.1 of Register of Marriages for the year \\n2007 and (v) Conveyance deed dated 03.12.2010.  \\n11. Defendant no.1 the vendor did not lead any \\nevidence , either oral or documentary. He failed to \\nappear and enter the witness box even to support \\nhis pleadings made in the written statements. \\nThere was also no cross -examination of PW -1 on \\nhis behalf.  \\n12. Defendant no.2 , the subsequent purchaser \\nexamined himself as DW -1, and further \\nexamined Ranjeet Pat il as DW -2, Parvez Patel as \\nDW-3, Sunit Patil as DW -4, Govind Rawaria as \\nDW-5. He also filed voluminous documents \\nrelating to revenue records, mutation entries, \\nsearch reports, copy of notices and various other \\ndocuments relating to his possession.  \\n13. The Trial Court, after considering the evidence \\nled by the parties, dismissed the suit, vide \\njudgment dated 24.02.2016 . The Trial Court \\nrecorded the following findings:  \\n13.1 Issues Nos.1,2,4,5 and 6 were decided in   \\nnegative , whereas Issues nos. 7, 8, 9 and 10 in \\nthe affirmative , mainly for the reason that the \\nappellant no.1 as also his brother were minor s Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 12 of 56 \\n at the time of the execution of the Sale Deed on \\n02.12.1985, as such could not have entered \\ninto a contract being  a minor and, therefore, \\nthe Sale Deed was void.   \\n14. The appellant s preferred appeal before the \\nDistrict Judge which was registered as Civil \\nAppeal No.28  of 2016. The District Judge, vide \\njudgment dated 7th March, 2019 allowed the \\nappeal, set aside the judgment of the Trial Court \\nand decreed the suit.  The first Appellate  Court \\nframed the following points for determination in \\nparagraph 14 of the judgment and in the said \\ntable, it also recorded the outcome of the said \\nfindings. The said table is reproduced below:  \\n“14. Heard the Ld. Advocates for both \\nthe parties. Perused the record and the \\nproceedings. Following points arise for \\nmy determination on which I have \\nrecorded my findings for the reasons to \\nfollow:  \\n \\nS.No.  Points  Findings  \\n1. Whether plaintiffs prove that \\nthey are in possession and \\noccupation of the suit \\nproperty?  …In the \\naffirmative.  \\n2. Whether plaintiffs prove that \\nthey are owners of the suit \\nland by virtue of registered \\nsale deed dated 02.12.1985?  …In the \\naffirmative.  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 13 of 56 \\n 3. Whether plaintiffs prove that \\nthe defendants were trying to \\ntake forcible possession of suit \\nproperty unauthorizedly?  …In the \\naffirmative.  \\n4. Whether plaintiffs prove that \\nthe deed of conveyance dated \\n03.12.2010 registered at sr. \\nno.9176 is void -ab-initio?  …In the \\naffirmative.  \\n5. Whether plaintiffs prove that \\nthey are entitled for relief of \\npermanent injunction?  …In the \\naffirmative.  \\n6. Whether plaintiffs prove that \\nthey are entitled for other \\nreliefs?  …In the \\naffirmative.  \\n7. Whether defendant no.1 \\nproves that the alleged \\nagreement to sale dated \\n02.12.1985 is void ab -initio?  …In the \\nnegative.  \\n8. Whether defendants prove \\nthat the suit is barred by Law \\nof Limitation?  …In the \\nnegative.  \\n9. Whether defendant no.2 \\nproves that sale deed dated \\n02.12.1985 was not \\nenforceable by law?  …In the \\nnegative.  \\n10. Whether defendant no.2 \\nproves that he is bona  fide \\npurchaser and in possession \\nof the suit property?  …In the \\nnegative.  \\n11. Whether judgment and decree \\nin Spl. Civil Suit No.46 of 2011 \\nrequires interference and is \\nliable to be set aside?  …In the \\naffirmative.  \\n12. What order?  As per final \\norder.  \\n” \\n15. In the analysis, the First Appellate  Court \\nrecorded the following findings also:  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 14 of 56 \\n 15.1.   It held  that the title of the property relates \\nback to the date of execution of the sale deed \\nand not the date of the registration.  \\n15.2.   It held that during the lifetime of the father, \\nmother can act as the natural guardian of \\nthe minor.  \\n15.3.   The defendants having failed to seek a \\ndeclaration of the sale deed dated \\n02.12.1985 being declared void ab -initio or \\nfor its cancellation , once the document is \\nduly registered by the Sub -Registrar, it is \\nonly the competent Civil Court which would \\nhave the jurisdiction to declare it as \\ncancel led or void ab -initio.  \\n15.4.  Merely because the challenge to the \\nprocedure has been made with respect to the \\nregistration, the submission of the \\ndefendants with respect to the delayed \\nregistration etc. gets washed out .  \\n16. The said judgment was assailed by way of Second \\nAppeal by the respondent no.1, the subsequent \\npurchaser (defendant no.2) only. No appeal was \\nfiled by the respondent no.2 (defendant no.1), Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 15 of 56 \\n vendor of the appellant.  This appeal was \\nregistered as Second Appeal No.649  of 2019.  \\n17. By the impugned judgment dated 09.06.2022, \\nthe High Court has allowed the same and after \\nsetting aside the judgment of the first Appellate  \\nCourt, restored that of the Trial Court and \\ndismissed the suit. It is this judgment of the High \\nCourt, which is under challenge in the present \\nappeal. The High Court framed the following \\nsubstantial question s of law in paragraph 12 of \\nthe judgment which are reproduced hereunder: - \\n“12. The substantial questions of law \\nraised in the appeal are:  \\ni) Whether execution of the sale deed \\ndated 02.12.1985 at Exhibit 54 \\nhas been duly proved;  \\nii) Whether the sale deed at Exhibit \\n54 conveys title in favour of \\nplaintiffs;  \\niii) Whether the findings of the first \\nAppellate  court on the issue of \\nexecution and validity of sale deed \\ndated 02.12.1985 are not based on \\nevidence on record and are \\nperverse.”  \\n \\n18. The High Court recorded the following findings:  \\n18.1.  The sale deed in question dated 02.12.1985 \\ncould not be held to be invalid for the sole Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 16 of 56 \\n reason that the deed was signed only by the \\nvendor and not by the vendees  (in favour of \\nplaintiffs).  \\n18.2.  The fact that the purchasers were minors \\nwould not per se  affect the validity of the sale \\ndeed (in favour of plaintiffs) .  \\n18.3.  It criticizes  the findings of the first Appellate  \\nCourt regarding the sale deed dated \\n02.12.1985 having been validly proved by \\nthe plaintiffs to be not based on \\nconsideration of material facts on record as \\ndiscussed and considered by the Trial Court \\nwhile holding that the sale deed was not \\nvalidly proved.  \\n18.4.  It considered in great detail the provisions  of \\nthe Registration Act to hold that the sale \\ndeed dated 02.12.1985 was not validly \\nregistered , as such , could not have been \\nrelied upon by the plaintiffs for any of the \\nreliefs claimed by them or to maintain the \\nsuit.  \\n19. We have heard Shri Vinay Navare, learned senior \\ncounsel for the appellant s, Shri Ranjit Kumar, \\nlearned senior counsel appearing for respondent Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 17 of 56 \\n No.2 and Shri Huzefa Ahmadi, learned senior \\ncounsel representing respondent No.1.  \\n20. The submissions of Shri Navare for the appellant \\nmay be summarized as under:  \\n20.1.  Respondent  No.2 did not specifically deny \\nexecution of the sale deed in favour of \\nappellant no.1 and his brother. He has only \\nstated in the written statement that he does \\nnot recollect to have executed any such \\ndocument.  \\n20.2.  Respondent  No.2 did not cross -examine the \\nappellant No.1 who had entered the witness \\nbox. The appellant No.1 had specifically \\nstated, not only in the plaint but also in his \\ndeposition, that respondent No.2 had \\nexecuted the sale deed on 02.12.1985  after \\nreceiving the sale consideration . \\n20.3.  Respondent No.2, although filed a written \\nstatement making vague assertions but \\nchose not to appear in the witness box \\napparently to avoid being cross -examined.  \\n20.4.  The first Appellate  Court had decreed the \\nsuit of the appellant but no appeal was filed \\nagainst the same by the respondent No.2. Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 18 of 56 \\n The only appeal filed before the High Court \\nwas by respondent No.1.  \\n20.5.  The objection as to the registration or the \\nprocedure  adopted while registering the sale \\ndeed was essentially available to respondent \\nNo.2 but he did not raise it in the written \\nstatement. Further respondent no.2  neither \\ncross -examined appellant No.1 nor did he \\nenter the witness box nor did he assail the \\njudgment of the first Appellate  Court \\ndecreeing the suit.  \\n20.6.  The only manner in which respondent No.2 \\ncould have challenged the sale deed in favour \\nof the appellant s was by way of either a \\ncounter -claim or by way of an independent \\nsuit praying for cancellation of the sale deed \\nby impleading the registering authority, \\nwhich he chose not to do.   \\n20.7.  As there was no counter -claim filed by the \\ndefendant, in particular ,  respondent No.2, \\nthe question of validity of execution  and \\nregistration of the Sale Deed dated \\n02.12.1985 in favour of the appellant no.1 \\nand his brother, could not be tested.  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 19 of 56 \\n 20.8.  The Trial Court did not frame any issue with \\nrespect to the validity of the registration \\nprocess or the registration of the sale deed by \\nthe registering authorities , after such a long \\ngap of 26 years . Without framing such an \\nissue, the Trial Court committed serious \\nerror and a patent illegality in recording a \\nfinding with regard to the registration \\nprocess and commenting on the registering \\nauthorities . Even the High Court committed \\nthe same illegality.  \\n20.9.  There is no limitation provided under the law \\nfor a sale deed which had been executed and \\nduly presented before the Registrar for \\nregistration, for such document to be \\nregistered within a particular time. Even if \\nthere was a gap of 26 years from the date of \\npresentation till the date of registrati on, it \\nwould not make any difference and the sale \\ndeed would relate back to the date of \\nexecution once registered.   \\n20.10.  The fact that the sale deed was duly executed \\non 02.12.1985 and thereafter presented for \\nregistration on 05.12.1985 is apparent from Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 20 of 56 \\n the fact that respondent No.2 on the same \\ndate i.e. 02.12.1985 had executed the sale \\ndeed for the remaining  half portion of Survey \\nNo.13/1 in favour of collaterals of the \\nappellant and further, the said sale deed in \\nfavour of the collaterals was also presented \\nfor registration on 05.12.1985 i.e. the same \\nday on which the appellant presented the \\nsale deed for registration. The sale deed of \\nthe collaterals was later on registered . \\nHowever, the sale deed of the appellant no.1 \\nremained pending for registration due to \\ndeficiency in stamp duty and was finally \\nregistered in 2011  after the deficiency was \\nremoved . \\n20.11.  The registration of the sale deed of the \\nappellant even after 26 years could not be \\nsaid to be faulted on that ground alone . The \\nsaid registration was never  challenged either \\nbefore superior authority of the registr ation \\ndepartment or before the High Court under \\nArticle 226 of the Constitution. Till date there \\nis no challenge to the said sale deed in favour \\nof the appellant either on the ground of non -Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 21 of 56 \\n execution by respondent No.2 or on the \\nground of the registration being faulty before \\nany forum whatsoever.  \\n20.12.  Reference to the deposition of appellant No.1 \\nhas been made to submit that the appellant \\nNo.1 nowhere stated that no sale \\nconsideration was paid but he only stated \\nthat he had not placed any documents on \\nrecord to show that the sale consideration of \\nRs.40,000/ - had been paid.  \\n20.13.  The arguments advanced on behalf of \\nrespondent No.1 that the appellant No.1 was \\na minor, as such the sale deed was void, also \\ndoes not benefit the respondent s inasmuch \\nas on behalf of the brother of the appellant \\nNo.1, who was stated to be a minor in the \\nsale deed , was duly represented by  his \\nmother, natural guardian . As such the sale \\nwould , in any case , be valid insofar as the \\nbrother of the appellant No.1 was \\nconcerned.   \\n20.14.  The collusion of respondent Nos.1 and 2 was \\nwrit large and more than apparent from the \\nconduct of  the respondent No.2 ; that he did Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 22 of 56 \\n not cross -examine the appellant no.1; he did \\nnot enter the witness box; he did not lead any \\nevidence and; he did not file any appeal \\nbefore the High Court.  \\n20.15.  Reliance was placed upon the judgment of \\nthis Court in the case of Alka Bose vs. \\nParmatma Devi and others3  wherein this \\nCourt had observed that in India, an \\nagreement of sale signed by the vendor alone \\nand possession delivered to the purchaser \\nand accepted by the purchaser has always \\nbeen considered to be a valid contract.   \\n20.16.  Lastly, it was submitted that the respondent \\nNo.1, the subsequent purchaser was not a \\nbona fide  purchaser . The sale deed in favour \\nof respondent No.1 has a clause that the \\nproperty was being sold on as is where is \\nbasis  which clearly reflects that respondent \\nno.1 had knowledge of the sale deed in favour \\nof appellant and about their possession.  \\n20.17.  On such submissions , learned counsel for \\nthe appellant s submitted that the appeal \\n \\n3 (2009) 2 SCC 582  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 23 of 56 \\n deserves to be allowed, the impugned order \\nof the High Court deserves to be set aside \\nand that of the first Appellate  Court be \\nmaintained.  \\n21. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned senior counsel \\nappearing for respondent No.2 made detailed \\nsubmissions which we shall note a little later. H e, \\nhowever, did not give any explanation whatsoever \\nas to why the respondent No.2 did not cross -\\nexamine the appellant No.1, why the respondent \\nNo.2 did not enter the witness box in support of \\nhis pleadings stated in the written statement , \\nwhy no evidence was led by him and why no \\nsecond appeal was preferred by respondent No.2 \\nagainst the judgment of the first Appellate  Court \\ndecreeing the suit. The submissions advanced on \\nbehalf of respondent no.2 are summarized \\nhereunder:  \\n21.1.  Much  emphasis has been laid on the fact \\nthat the sale deed in favour of appellant was \\nregistered after 26 years.  \\n21.2.  With respect to the arguments relating to \\nsale deed in favour of respondent No.1 \\nmentioning on as is where is basis , the Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 24 of 56 \\n submission is that as there was \\nencroachment on the suit property by the \\nlocal tribal people as such this clause was \\ninserted so that respondent No.2 would not \\nbe s addled with any further liability of \\nhanding over a clear and vacant pos session.  \\n21.3.  The suit instituted by the appellant as \\nframed , was not maintainable inasmuch as \\nno relief of declaration of title was sought and \\nonly relief claimed was for cancellation of the \\nsale deed dated 03.12.2010 executed in \\nfavour of respondent No.1 and further  for \\ngrant of permanent injunction. This was \\ndeliberately done as suit for declaration \\nwould be time barred.  \\n21.4.  Once the pleadings have been exchanged \\nand the issues are framed , the burden would \\nlie on both the parties to establish their cases \\nand it would be wrong on the part of the \\nappellant to argue that the burden would be \\non the respondent alone with respect to \\ncertain issues.  \\n21.5.  The appellant  No.1 has admitted that he did \\nnot know the details of the bank, cheque Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 25 of 56 \\n number, the date of the cheque, etc. and that \\nhe had no documents to show that \\nconsideration of Rs.40,000/ - was paid \\nexcept for the fact that it was mentioned in \\nthe sale deed. Reference was also made to \\nsection 25 of the Act ,1872  to submit that the \\nagreement s without consideration are void \\nagreements.   \\n21.6.  Appellant  No.1 had admitted that the \\nproperty was not recorded in his name and \\nthat he had applied to the revenue \\nauthorities to record his name which he was \\npursuing from 1996.   \\n21.7.  Appellant  No.1 declined to produce the \\npleadings of Special Civil Suit No.812 of \\n1996, the partition suit between the \\nmembers of the family. Appellant No.1 \\nadmits of not challenging the Mutation Entry \\nNo.668 recorded in favour of respondent \\nNo.1 pursuant to the sale deed dated \\n03.12.2010.   \\n21.8.  Appellant No.1 admitted  of not having \\nclearance and prior sale permission from the Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 26 of 56 \\n competent authority which was a pre -\\ncondition for purchase of suit property.   \\n21.9.  The appellant No.1 admitted that the word \\n“cash” in the sale deed was scored out and \\nthe word “ cheque ” was mentioned in its place \\nand that on some pages of the sale deed, full \\nsignature of his mother are not there rather \\nit has initials.   \\n21.10.  The appellant No.1 admitted that he does not \\nremember as to who had presented the sale \\ndeed for registration in the year 1985 and \\nadmits that he was not the one who \\npresented.   \\n21.11.  With respect to the submission that the suit \\nwas not maintainable as relief of declaration \\nof title was not sought , reliance was placed \\nupon the judgment of this Court in the cases \\nof Anathula Sudhakar vs. P. Buchi Reddy \\n& Ors.4 and Raghwendra Sharan Singh vs. \\nRam Prasanna Singh by LR5. \\n21.12.  Appellant No.1 had admitted in his \\ndeposition that he was a minor at the time of \\n \\n4 (2008) 4 SCC 594, (relevant paras 13 -16, 21)  \\n5 (2020) 16 SCC 601 (para 7 -10). Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 27 of 56 \\n the execution of the sale deed on 02.12.1985 \\nand the age shown in the sale deed that he \\nwas 18 years was incorrect. Under Section \\n11 of the Act,  1872  a minor is not competent \\nto enter into a contract and as the appellant \\nNo.1 admitted that he was a minor at the \\ntime of the sale deed, the said contract would \\nbe void ab initio . Reliance was placed upon a \\njudgment of this Court in the case of Mathai \\nMathai  vs. Joseph Mary & Ors.6. \\n21.13.  The burden of proof was on the plaintiff, who \\nhas based the suit on the sale deed dated \\n02.12.1985 to prove the same to be a valid \\nsale. As the Trial Court recorded the finding \\nthat the appellant s had failed to establish \\ntheir right , title and interest in the suit \\nproperty, there was shifting of the onus on \\nthe respondent No.2 would not arise and \\nthere was no necessity or requirement of the \\nrespondent  No.2 to enter the witness box as \\nthe same would be of no consequence. \\nReliance was placed upon the judgment of \\n \\n6 (2015) 5 SCC 622 (para 16 -19).  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 28 of 56 \\n this Court in Smriti Debbarma vs. Prabha \\nRanjan Debbarma7. \\n21.14.  Referring to section 114 of the Indian \\nEvidence Act ,18728 regarding presumption  \\nof existence of certain facts by the Court, it \\nwas submitted that although the said \\npresumption is rebuttable but as the \\nappellant No.1 in his cross -examination has \\nmade various admissions which were \\nsufficient to decide the fate of the suit against \\nhim, it was not necessary for the respondent \\nno.2 to either cross -examine him or to enter \\nthe witness  box. Reliance was placed upon \\nthe judgment of this Court in the case of \\nKunda wd/o Mahadeo Supare & Ors. vs. \\nHaribhau s/o Husan Supare9. \\n21.15.  Appellant No.1 also admits that serial \\nnumbers of the stamps are not in \\ncontinuation and that regular registration \\nprocess of the sale deed was not complete at \\n \\n7 (2023) SCC On  Line SC 9 (para 35).  \\n8 The Evidence Act  \\n9 (2014) 5 Mah. L.J.726 (para 8).  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 29 of 56 \\n the time when the sale deed of 2010 in favour \\nof respondent No.1 was registered.   \\n21.16.  Relying upon section 54 of the Transfer of \\nProperty Act, 188210 read with section 17 \\nand 49 of the Registration Act, the \\nsubmission is that an unregistered sale deed \\ncould not have been received in evidence as \\nno title would pass on the basis of an \\nunregistered document relating to \\nimmovable property. As such the respondent \\nNo.2 continued to be the owner of the suit \\nproperty holding a valid titl e over the same. \\nReliance has been placed upon the following \\njudgments:  \\n•  Raghunath & Ors. vs. Kedar Nath11;  \\n• Bondar Singh & Ors. Vs. Nihal Singh & \\nOrs.12; \\n• Suraj Lamps and Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. \\nState of Haryana and Anr.13;  \\n \\n10 The TP Act  \\n11 (1969) 1 SCC 497 (para 3);  \\n12  (2003) 4 SCC 161 (para 5);  \\n13 (2009) 7 SCC 363 (para 15 -18); Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 30 of 56 \\n • S. Kaladevi v. V.R. Somasundaram & \\nOrs.14; and  \\n• M/s Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd. vs. \\nAmit Chand Mitra & Anr.15. \\n21.17.  Lastly it was submitted that as mandatory \\nlegal conditions were not fulfilled for the \\nregistration of the sale deed dated \\n02.12.1985, the same could not have been \\ntreated as a registered sale deed.   \\n21.18.  To elaborate the above argument following \\nfurther facts were stated:  \\na) Appellant No.1 in his cross -examination (at \\nPg.135) has admitted that Defendant No.1 \\n(original Vendor) was not called for completing \\nprocess of registration on 14.06.2011 and that \\nthere is no endorsement of the Sub -Registrar on \\nthe last page of Sale Deed about completion of \\nregistrat ion. Therefore, the mandates of Section \\n60, which prescribes as to what constitutes a \\nCertificate of registration is not fulfilled and \\nhence, the alleged sale deed was not validly \\nregistered on 14.06.2011 and therefore, alleged \\n \\n14 (2010) 5 SCC 401 [para 12,13,15]  \\n15 SLP No.15774 of 2023.  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 31 of 56 \\n sale deed dated 02.12.1985 cannot be treated as \\na registered sale deed.  \\nb) That the alleged sale deed was registered in \\nviolation of Section 32 of the Indian Stamp Act , \\n1899  and Section s 17 and 20 of the Act, 1908 . \\nThe essential requirement under Section 54 of \\nthe TP Act were also not fulfilled. That from the \\nrecord as well as the admission of appellant \\nno.1, it is clear from the s erial number of the \\nstamps that the same are not in continuum.   \\nc) As per Section 32 of the Stamp Act when any \\ninstrument is brought to the Collector then the \\nCollector may determine the Stamp Duty. That \\nin the present case , the alleged Sale Deed shows \\nthat at the time of presentation the stamp of \\nRs.1600/ - was given but on 14.06.2011 the \\nSub-Registrar accepted extra amount of \\nRs.2200/ - and penalty of Rs.500/ - but there is \\nno endorsement to show that it was sent to the \\nCollector for determining the Stamp duty and it \\nis not shown in the Sale Deed that d eficit stamp \\nduty was  affixed. As per Section s 33 and 34 of \\nthe Stamp Act, the Collector has power to \\nimpound the document.  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 32 of 56 \\n d) The alleged sale deed does not show that under \\nwhich provision of law the Sub -Registrar had \\naccepted the deficit charges after 2 6 years and \\nno reasons were given as to why it was kept \\npending for such a long time.   \\ne) Even if assuming for the sake of arguments \\nwithout admitting that the alleged sale deed was \\npresented before the Sub-Registrar , the same \\nwas unclaimed for 26 years and hence, by \\noperation of Section 85, documents unclaimed \\nfor more than two years are required to be \\ndestroyed.  \\nf) Compulsory affixing of photograph on the \\nconveyance deed is also not followed at the time \\nof registration process.  Reliance was placed on \\nthe case of Veena Singh (dead) Thr. LRs. \\nDistrict Registrar/Additional Collector16. \\n22. Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, learned Senior Counsel \\nappearing for respondent No.1, the subsequent \\npurchaser , has mainly laid stress on the point \\nthat respondent No.1 was a bona fide  purchaser \\nhaving  exercised due diligence as such the re \\n \\n16 (2022) 7 SCC 1  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 33 of 56 \\n would be no justification of cancellation of sale \\ndeed executed in his favour.  \\n23. Mr. Ahmadi  has also broadly submitted that the \\nappellant n o.1 had failed to prove the basis of \\nclaim i.e. the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 and as \\nsuch had not acquired any right, title or interest \\nin the suit property. The respondent No.2 , \\ntherefore , was well within his rights to execute \\nthe sale deed in favour of the respondent No.1 in \\n2010. He has also referred to the statement of \\nappellant No.1 in order to show certain \\nadmissions which already have been pointed out \\nand noted above in the arguments of Mr. Ranjit \\nKumar, learned senior counsel appearing for \\nresponde nt No.2. In so far as th e main \\nsubmission regarding bona fide  purchase for \\nvalue without notice , he referred to Section 41 of \\nthe TP Act , 188217. Reliance has been placed \\nupon the following judgements:  \\n1. Sukhwinder Singh vs. Jagroop Singh and \\nAnr.18,  \\n \\n17 TP Act  \\n18 2020 SCC Online SC 86  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 34 of 56 \\n 2. Seethakathi Trust Madras vs. Krishnaveni19,  \\n3. Hansa V. Gandhi vs. Deep Shankar Roy20,  \\n4. Hardev Singh vs. Gurmail Singh21,  \\n5. Raghwendra Sharan Singh vs. Ram Prasanna \\nSingh by LR22.  \\n \\n24. In the additional written submissions , \\nrespondent no.1 has placed further reliance \\nupon two judgments of this Court , for the \\nproposition that the sale contract with the minor \\neven though he was the vendee, would be void \\nab-initio. The two cases are Mathai vs. Mathai23, \\nand another recent judgment dated 15.02.2024  \\npassed in Civil Appeal No.2591 of 2024 @ \\nSLP(Civil) No.23655 of 2019, Krishnaveni vs. \\nM.A. Shagul Hameed and another .  Further, \\nreliance was placed upon another judgment of \\nthis Court dated 15.02.2024  in C.A. No.002458 \\nof 2024, Babasaheb Dhondiba Kure vs. Radha \\nVithoba Barde  for the proposition that \\n \\n19 (2022) 3 SCC 150  \\n20 (2013) 12 SCC 776  \\n21 (2007) 2 SCC 404  \\n22 (2020) 16 SCC 601  \\n23 (2015) 5 SCC 622  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 35 of 56 \\n conveyance by way of sale would take place only \\nat the time of registration of a sale deed in \\naccordance with section 17 of the Act, 1908.  \\nLastly, it is submitted that the suit was not \\nmaintainable as no relief for declaration of title \\nwas sought for which  reliance was placed upon \\njudgment of this Court in the case of The \\nTehsildar, Urban Improvement Trust and Anr. \\nvs. Ganga Bai Menariya (dead) through Lrs. \\nand others24.  \\n25. Both the learned senior counsel for the \\nrespondents  thus submitted that the appeal was \\ndevoid of merit and liable to be dismissed.  \\n26. From the submissions advanced and the perusal \\nof the material on record, the following \\nissues/questions arise for consideration in  the \\npresent appeal:  \\n1) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was \\nexecuted by Respondent No. 2?  \\n2) Whether the sale consideration was paid with \\nrespect to sale deed dated 02.12.1985?  \\n \\n24 (2024) 2 SCR 650  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 36 of 56 \\n 3) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was \\npresented for registration on 05.12.1985 or not?  \\n4) Whether delayed registration of the sale deed \\ndated 02.12.1985 would prove to be fatal ? \\n5) Whether non -mutation would take away the \\nright created by the sale deed in favor of the \\nvendees ?  \\n6) Whether respondent no.2 had any right, title or \\ninterest left in the suit property after \\n02.12.1985?  \\n7) Whether the sale deed dated 02.12.1985 was \\nvoid as the vendees were alleged to be minors?  \\n8) Whether the respondent no. 1 was a bona  fide \\npurchaser for value by way of a s ubsequent sale \\ndeed dated 03.12.2010 ?  \\n27. Having considered the submissions advanced by \\nthe counsels for the parties our analysis  on the \\nissues stated above is as under . As the \\nissues/questions raised are interlinked, they \\nhave been taken up together in our analysis . \\n28. At the outset, it may be relevant to refer to the \\ncertified/xerox copy of the sale deed dated \\n2.12.1985, presented for registration on \\n5.12.1985, copies of which were filed by both the Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 37 of 56 \\n sides under the direction of th is Court. We have \\ncarefully perused the sale deed. The following \\nfacts may be noticeable from the said perusal:  \\n(i). The stamp paper had been purchased on \\n29.11.1985.  \\n(ii). The document was prepared and executed on \\n02.12.1985  \\n(iii). The document was presented before the Sub -\\nRegistrar on 5.12.1985. The total value of the \\nstamp paper used was Rs 1,600/ -.  \\n(iv). The document was presented by respondent \\nno.2, the vendor.  \\n(v). The document bears the signature of Anees \\nIsmail Khoja, respondent no. 2, the witnesses  \\nand also contains the respective endorsement \\nby the Sub -Registrar.  \\n(vi). The document was impounded for non -payment \\nof proper stamp duty . However, on 14.6.2011  \\nthe deficiency in stamp duty of Rs.2200/ - along \\nwith penalty  of Rs.500/ - and other statutory \\npayments  of Rs.700/ - having been paid, it was \\nfinally registered in Book No. 1 from pages 141 -\\n147. Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 38 of 56 \\n (vii). The document bears the signature s of not only \\nthe vendor,  the attesting witnesses and also the \\nnecessary endorsement by the Sub -Registrar. \\nThis makes it abundantly clear that the sale \\ndeed was executed  on 02.12.1985  and \\npresented before the Sub -Registrar on \\n5.12.1985. Later on, it was registered on \\n14.06.2011.  \\n \\n29. The Trial Court and the High Court had \\nproceeded on the premise that the defendant \\nNo.1 - the vendor (respondent no.2 herein) had \\ndenied the execution of the sale deed and had \\nalso denied that he had not received any \\nconsideration. This premise taken by both the \\nCourts i.e. Trial Court and the High Court are \\ncontrary to the pleadings on record and the \\nevidence led during the Trial. There is clear \\nmisreading of the evide nce. In his written \\nstatement in paragraph 7 defendant no.1 \\n(vendor) has stated that he does not recollect \\nhaving executed the sale deed. He has not \\nspecifically denied anywhere in the written \\nstatement that he had not executed the sale deed Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 39 of 56 \\n or that the signatures on the sale deed were not \\nhis signatures. Thus, the very premise on the \\nbasis of which the Trial Court and the High Court \\nproceeded are perverse being contrary to the \\nmaterial on record. Both the said courts also \\nfailed to take into consideration that defendant \\nno.1 the vendor (respondent no.2 herein) neither \\nentered the witness box in support of his \\npleadings and to prove them , nor did lead any \\nevidence , either oral or documentary , in support \\nof his pleadings. There was no justificat ion to \\ntreat a vague statement in the written statement \\nof not recollecting about execution of sale deed, \\nto be taken as a denial of the execution. The \\ndefendant no.1 - the vendor was deliberately and \\nmischievously avoiding to make specific \\nstatement either denying his signatures on the \\nsale deed or his presentation before the Sub -\\nRegistrar or had not received any sale \\nconsideration. The Trial Court and the High \\nCourt fel l into the trap of clever drafting and a \\nvague statement of defendant no.1.  \\n30. The Trial Court and the High Court also \\ncommitted a manifest error in recording that the Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 40 of 56 \\n defendant no.1 - vendor (respondent no.2 herein) \\nhad denied having received any sale \\nconsideration with respect to the sale deed dated \\n02.12.1985. In the written statement filed by the \\ndefendant no.1, there is no such statement \\nmade. In case he had made such a statement \\nthen he would be admitting the execution but \\nwithout consideration. Both the Courts again \\nmisread the deposition of appellant no.1 (PW -1) \\nwherein he said that he does not have any proof \\nof payment of the consideration to hold that no \\nsale con sideration was paid. A registered \\ndocument carries with it presumption of \\ncorrectness unless proved otherwise  as per \\nSection 114 of the Evidence Act read with Section \\n17 of the Act, 1908 . In the present case there is \\nno such evidence.  \\n31. The defendant  no.1 having not entered the \\nwitness box and not having led any evidence, it \\nwas a mere presumption of the Trial Court and \\nthe High Court to have recorded that defendant \\nno.1 denied receiving any sale consideration.  \\n32. Based upon the aforesaid two factual errors, the \\nTrial Court and the High Court wrongly shifted Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 41 of 56 \\n the burden on the plaintiff to prove execution of \\nthe sale deed and also payment of the sale \\nconsideration. The impugned judgment thus \\nsuffers from manifest error of law and facts both.  \\n33. The appeal deserves to be allowed on several \\nother grounds which we are dealing hereunder \\nand hereinafter.  \\n33.1.  It is not disputed by respondent No.2 that on \\n02.12.1985, he had executed another sale \\ndeed with respect to the remaining portion of \\nsurvey No.13/1 in favour of the collaterals of \\nthe appellants, namely , Param Umakant \\nMishra and Sohardha Mishra. This sale deed \\nin favour of the collateral was presented for \\nregistration on the same date as the sale \\ndeed of the appellant i.e. 05.12.1985 and was \\nthereafter duly registered. The respondent \\nNo.2 has never challenged t he said sale deed \\nin favour of the collaterals.  It is thus \\napparent  that the family members and \\ncollaterals of the appellants purchased the \\nentire survey No. 13/1  measuring 3.40 \\nHectares  from respondent No.2 in equal  \\nshares by two separate documents which Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 42 of 56 \\n were executed on the same date and \\npresented for registration on the same day. \\nDespite the fact that specific query was put \\nto learned  senior counsel for respondent no.2 \\nwith regard to the above aspect , no answer \\nwas given. In the plaint specific averment \\nwas made with regard to the sale deed in \\nfavour of the collaterals. There is no specific \\ndenial in the written statement filed by \\nrespondent No.2 about the sale deed in \\nfavour of collaterals. General denial has been \\nmade by placing strict proof of liability on the \\nplaintiff.  \\n33.2.  The respondent No.2 apparently wants to \\ntake advantage of certain minor aberration s \\nand minor technicalities and is also taking \\nup self -conflicting pleas.  \\n33.3.  The sale deed is sought to be ignored and \\nrejected on account of a minor cutting/over \\nwriting with regard to the word ‘cash’ (Roch) \\nby ‘cheque ’. The fact remains that \\nrespondent No.2 did not enter the witness \\nbox to depose that he has not received any \\nsale consideration either by way of cash or by Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 43 of 56 \\n way of cheque and further to state that he \\nhad not executed the sale deed and the \\nsignatures  and thumb impression on the \\nsale deed are not his. He also did not come \\nforward to say that the signatures  and \\nthumb impression  available in the Sub-\\nRegistrar’s office in the register taken at the \\ntime for registration also did not bear his \\nsignatures.  \\n33.4.  Another aspect submitted on behalf of \\nrespondent  was that the appellant No.1 in \\nhis deposition has said that he had no proof  \\nof the payment of the sale consideration, to \\nassert that the appellant No.1 admitted that \\nhe had not paid any sale consideration is not \\ncorrect. Appellant No.1 was being examined \\nsometime after 2013, i.e. after a gap of 28 \\nyears from the date of the sale deed . He could \\nnot be expected to remember such facts \\ndistinctly and as such he made a fair \\nstatement that he did not have any \\ndocument that could  prove the passing of the \\nsale consideration.  This would not , by itself , \\nbe interpreted to hold that appellant  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 44 of 56 \\n admitted of not paying any sale \\nconsideration.  \\n33.5.  The question of payment of sale \\nconsideration would arise only and only if the \\nvendor makes a specific statement in his \\npleadings as also in his deposition in support \\nof the pleading that he did not receive any \\nsale consideration either  by way of cheque  or \\nby cash. There is no such pleading and as \\nthe vendor did not enter the witness box, \\neven if there was any such pleading, there is \\nno statement to prove such pleading.  Thus, \\nthe above argument  being  based on minor \\ndiscrepancy in the statement of the \\nappellant, no benefit can be derived by the \\nrespondents . The argument is accordingly \\nrejected.  \\n33.6.  There is one more reason to reject this \\nargument. Even  if assuming that no sale \\nconsideration was paid even though there \\nwas a registered sale deed, it would be at the \\ninstance of the vendor to challenge the said \\nsale deed on the ground of no sale \\nconsideration being paid. In the present Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 45 of 56 \\n case, there is no such challenge to the sale \\ndeed for being declared as void or being \\ncancelled on such ground. Thus also, the \\nsaid argument deserve s to be rejected.  \\n33.7.  It has also been argued on behalf of the \\nrespondents that appellant No.1 , in his \\ndeposition , stated that he did not remember \\nas to who had presented the document for \\nregistration. Such statement would not be \\nrelevant at all inasmuch as  the fact remains \\nthat the document of sale was presented for \\nregistration on 05.12.1985, which fact is not \\ndenied. Who presented the document is not \\nrelevant. It was for the registering authority \\nto examine and once the document is \\nregistered, it is presumed that it was \\nprese nted by the competent person and \\nnecessary signatures of the vendor and \\nvendee must have been taken by the \\nregistering authority.  From a perusal of the \\nxerox copy of the sale deed it is apparent that \\nthere is an endorsement by the Sub -\\nRegistrar that the sale deed was presented by Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 46 of 56 \\n respondent no.2, the vendor (defendant no.1 \\nin the suit).  \\n33.8.  The submission with regard to delay of 26 \\nyears in getting the document registered also \\ndoes not extend any benefit to the \\nrespondents. Non -registration of a document \\nduly presented for registration could be for \\nmany reasons. But once it is registered, there \\nis a presumption of correctness attached to \\nit, that is to say that the document has been \\nduly executed and registered in accordance \\nto law. It was for the defendant s \\n(respondents) to come forward and to \\nestablish that the document was wrongly \\nregistered. They did not l ead any evidence in \\nthis respect. Instead, they tried to put \\nburden on the plaintiff -appellant by \\nrequiring him to call the Sub-Registrar as a \\nwitness, which the appellant rightly  denied. \\nIt was always open for the respondents to \\nhave call ed for the records of the Sub-\\nRegistrar’s office and also the Sub-Registrar \\nin order to find out any mandatory lacuna or \\nillegality or lack of procedure not being Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 47 of 56 \\n followed with respect to the registration. \\nThey did nothing of this sort.  \\n33.9.  In fact, respondent No.2 did not make any \\nbone of contention with regard to the \\nregistration process and the registration of \\nthe documents after 26 years by challenging \\nthe same before the same authority or any \\nsuperior authority or any Court of law. \\nRegistration of a document carries with it \\npresumption of correctness until and unless \\nthe same was challenged by way of \\nindependent proceeding or a counter claim . \\nIn the absence of any such claim , the sale \\ndeed in favour of the appellant s has to be  \\ntreated as a valid document.  \\n33.10.  Much stress has been laid by Mr. Ranjit \\nKumar,  and Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi  learned \\nsenior counsel appearing for respondent s \\nthat once the appellant No.1 admitted that \\nhe was a minor at the time of execution of the \\nsale deed and that his age was incorrectly \\nrecorded as 18 years in the sale deed, the \\nsale deed would be void ab initio  and would \\nnot transfer any right, title or interest in the Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 48 of 56 \\n favour of the appellants. This submission is \\nagain liable to be rejected . The sale deed was \\nin favour of two persons, appellant No.1 as \\nalso his minor brother, A mbrish who was \\nmentioned to be a minor in the sale deed and \\nwas represented through his natural \\nguardian, his mother . The sale deed, \\ntherefore, in any case , would be valid in so \\nfar as the rights of A mbrish are concerned. \\nRespondent No.2 for 2 6 years never came \\nforward to return the sale consideration and \\nfor rescinding the contract of sale. His \\nintentions are cl early tainted with malice and \\ndishonesty. His conduct throughout the trial \\nand at appeal stage also reflects the same.  \\n33.11.  The issue of minority of appellant no.1 would \\nalso not be of any relevance  for the reason \\nthat even if he was a minor at the time of the \\nexecution of the sale deed and he had so \\nstated honestly in his deposition, the fact \\nremains that the mother of appellant No.1 \\nwas already representing his younger \\nbrother as guardian who was s tated to be a \\nminor in the sale deed. She was also the Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 49 of 56 \\n natural guardian of appellant no.1, and \\ntherefore, it would be deemed that she was \\nacting on behalf of both her minor sons.  \\n33.12.  The High Court recorded the findings that \\nthe fact that the purchasers were minors \\nwould not per se  affect the validity of the sale \\ndeed for the reason that the second \\npurchaser Ambrish who was mentioned as a \\nminor in the sale deed was represented \\nthrough his natural guardian and mother \\nSmt. Malti Premkumar Mishra and also that \\nthe age of the first purc haser Kaushik was \\nmentioned to be 18 years in the sale deed.  \\n33.13.  The respondent no.2 appears to be a \\ndishonest person. We are saying so for very \\nstrong reasons, which are apparent from his \\nconduct not only during the trial but also \\nacting in collusion with respondent no.1 to \\nexecute the sale deed for the same land \\nwhich he had already transferred. The issue \\nof registration of a document is with the \\nState, which requires compulsory \\nregistration of documents so that it is not \\ndeprived of revenue by way of stamp duty Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 50 of 56 \\n payable on such transfers of immovable \\nproperty.  If the purchaser has no means to \\npay stamp duty or exorbitant demand of \\nstamp duty is made by the registering \\nauthority which the purchaser is unable to \\npay at that time but he remains satisfied with \\nthe fact that the vendor has fairly and duly \\nexecuted the sale deed presented it for \\nregistration and put him in possession of the \\npurchased property which he is peacefully \\nenjoying, he is always at liberty to pay the \\ndeficiency of stamp duty at any point of time . \\nThe document presented for registration will \\nremain with the Registering Authority till \\nsuch time, the deficiency is removed. \\nHowever, this pendency of registration on \\naccount of deficiency cannot enure any \\nbenefit to the vendor, who has already \\neliminated all his rights by executing the sale \\ndeed after receiving the sale consideration. \\nHe cannot become the owner  of the \\ntransferred land merely because the \\ndocument of sale is pending for registration.  \\nIt is the purchaser who cannot produce such Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 51 of 56 \\n document which is pending registration  with \\nrespect to the immovable property in \\nevidence before the Court of law as the same \\nwould be inadmissible in view of statutory \\nprovision contained in the TP Act as also the \\nAct, 1908 . \\n34. Coming to the submission of Mr. Ahmadi, \\nlearned senior counsel for the subsequent \\npurchaser -respondent No.1 , his claim  would \\ncome  up for consideration only if it is finally held \\nthat the sale deed of 02.12.1985 was not a valid \\nsale deed. As otherwise all the rights, title and \\ninterest of the vendor - respondent no.2 would be \\ncurtailed from the date of execution of the first \\nsale deed on 02.12.1985.  As we have already \\nheld above that the sale deed cannot be \\ndiscarded as void ab initio , rather we have held \\nthat it is a valid document of sale, therefore, no \\nbenefit can be extended to respondent  no.1. \\nRespondent no.1 would enter the shoes of the \\nrespondent no.2. If respondent no.2 had \\nalienated  all his rights, title and interest and also \\ndelivered possession, respondent no.1 could not Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 52 of 56 \\n claim to be a bona  fide purchaser for value \\nwithout notice.  \\n35. The doctrine of bona fide  purchaser for value \\napplies in situations where the seller appears to \\nhave some semblance of legitimate ownership \\nrights. However, this principle does not protect a \\nsubsequent purchaser if the vendor had already \\ntransferred those rights through a prior sa le \\ndeed. In a case where the vendor deceitfully \\nexecutes a second sale deed 2 6 years after the \\ninitial transfer, without disclosing the earlier \\ntransaction and without any ongoing litigation \\nregarding the property, the subsequent \\npurchaser cannot claim the benefits of a bona \\nfide purchaser. Essentially, if the vendor's rights \\nwere already severed by the first sale, any later \\nsale deed made without transparency and in bad \\nfaith is invalid. The subsequent purchaser, even \\nif unaware of the prior sale, cannot be considered \\nbona fide  because the vendor no longer had the \\nlegal right to sell the property. Thus, the \\nprotection afforded by the bona fide  purchaser \\ndoctrine is nullified by the vendor's deceitful \\nconduct and the pre -existing transfer of rights. Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 53 of 56 \\n This ensures that the original purchaser's rights \\nare upheld and prevents unjust enrichment \\nthrough fraudulent transactions.  \\n36. This is not a case of agreement to sell in favour \\nof appellants but is a case of sale deed \\ntransferring ownership rights and possession.  It \\nwould be open to respondent no.1 to avail such \\nremedy as may be available under law to recover \\nthe sale consideration paid by him to respondent \\nNo.2. The sale deed in favour of the respondent \\nNo.1 dated 03.12.2010 needs to be cancelled and \\nthe registering authority be directed to score out \\nthe same from the records  as directed by the first \\nAppellate  Court.  \\n37. Another  argument raised that the sale deed did \\nnot contain the signatures of the mother also \\ndeserves to be rejected. Prior to insertion of \\nsection 32A in the Act , 1908  in the year 2001 \\nthere was no requirement under law that the \\nvendee must mandatorily sign the document of \\nsale for immovable property and also affix \\npassport size photograph and thumb impression \\nalong with proof of identification. In the present Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 54 of 56 \\n case the sale deed was presented for registration \\nin 1985 , much before 2001.  \\n38. Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned  senior  Counsel \\nappearing for Respondent No. 2, has relied upon \\nthe following judgments in order to substantiate \\nhis arguments pertaining to the issue of \\nregistration of the sale deed:  \\na. Raghunath Singh & Ors . v. Kedar Nath25,   \\nb. Bondar Singh &  Ors. v. Nihal Singh & \\nOrs.26,   \\nc. Suraj Lamps and Industries Pvt. Ltd . v. \\nState of Haryana and Anr.27,    \\nd. S. Kaladevi  v. V.R. Somasundaram & \\nOrs.28,   \\ne. M/s Paul Rubber Industries Pvt. Ltd.  v. \\nAmit Chand Mitra & Anr.29,   \\nf. Maya Devi v. Lalta Prasad30,   \\ng. Veena Singh (dead) thr. LRs . v. District \\nRegistrar/Additional Collector31 \\n \\n25 (1969) 1 SCC 497  \\n26 (2003)4 SCC 161  \\n27 (2009) 7 SCC 363  \\n28 (2010) 5 SCC 401  \\n29 SLP (C )No.15774 of 2023 decided on 25.09.2023  \\n30 (2015) 3 SCC 588  \\n31 (2022) 7 SCC 1  Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 55 of 56 \\n  \\n39. We observe that the cases relied upon by the \\nRespondent No. 2 do not extend any kind of  \\nbenefit in the facts of the present case as the \\njudgments above are clearly distinguishable on \\nfacts. Thus, to avoid lending any further burden \\non the instant judgment, we are not dealing with \\nthem on their individual facts.  \\n40. In view of the discussions  made above, the appeal \\ndeserves to be allowed. The impugned judgement \\nof the High Court is set aside and that of the first \\nAppellate  Court decreeing suit of the appellant is \\nrestored and maintained.   \\n41. Facts of this case deserves that the suit should \\nbe decreed with exemplary  costs considering the \\nconduct of the defendant -respondents, which is \\nquantified at Rs.10,00,000/ - (Rupees ten lakhs \\nonly) to be paid to the appellants within eight \\nweeks from today. The liability to pay costs shall \\nbe borne equally by each of the two resp ondents. \\nProof of payment of costs may be filed before this \\nCourt within ten weeks from today.   \\n Civil Appeal No. 1573  of 20 23  Page 56 of 56 \\n      \\n42.
